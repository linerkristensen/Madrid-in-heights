		   <p class="green infoText">
		   	While many hotels in Madrid have rooftop areas, there are few as impressive as Hotel Emperador's. The rooftop is distinguished by the size and elegance of the outdoor swimming pool and the calming rooftop garden. Located on the 10th floor, this relaxing urban sanctuary offers stunning views of the Madrid skyline, including famous landmarks like the Gran VÃ­a, the Royal Palace and Almudena Cathedral.

			<br>
			From May to September, hotel guests enjoy complimentary access to the cool waters of our pool encircled by comfortable lounge chairs, a soothing solarium, a snack bar and restaurant and relaxing areas for lounging and socialising over drinks and light fare.
