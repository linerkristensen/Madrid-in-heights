		   <p class="yellow infoText">
		   		With superb views and food just as special, the terrace at Cafe del Rio is perfect for any occasion. Located within the heart of Madrid Río, the terrace looks over the Royal Palace, the Almudena Cathedral, and the Puente de Segovia (Bridge of Segovia). 
			   <br>
			   <br>
			   However, these extravagant views are not accompanied by extravagant prices, rather Restaurante Café del Río boasts a reasonably priced menu. A variety of light meals, including oysters, crab, or lobster salad, are available or a menu that changes daily, served from 13:00-16:00hr for 10.50 (or 12 euros on the terrace) is offered as well. The terrace is also open for those wishing to just enjoy a cocktail.
