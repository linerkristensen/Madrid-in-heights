		   	The Barceló Market opens the summer season by opening a terrace located on the roof of its facilities. It can be accessed both from the inside of the market itself, and from the escalators that give access from the street to the Forus Barceló Sports Center, located on the last floors of the market. In fact, the terrace has been opened, in large part, thinking of the users of this sports center, with a gastronomic proposal of the most healthy.

			Although the terrace has already been used for a long time - to teach some outdoor taichi and yoga classes, for example, or simply to admire the views from there - it has now been when you wanted to give that profile more hotelier, creating a space where you can eat and drink from morning to night.
