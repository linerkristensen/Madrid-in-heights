			Our Solarium is located on the Terraza (rooftop terrace, 7th floor), surrounded by plants, cypresses and olive trees, a lush urban garden growing on one of Madrid’s most privileged observation decks, offering unparalleled “gargoyle’s-eye views” of the city. Step into our Solarium with more than 20 lounge chairs to bask in the sunshine and listen to the soothing sound of the water in our overflow pool or enjoy an invigorating outdoor shower. Naturally, the best views of the city centre and the most awe-inspiring sunsets are guaranteed.
